- keypoints locations out of the image - i.e. matching.py:191 (when 'if 0 <= x < sh1 and 0 <= y < sh0') fails
    - just add an assert to the kpts before the rectification and afterwards and see what happens

 - notes: commit 9ec12ec
 - https://realpython.com/python-matplotlib-guide/

- to be investigated:
- frame_0000000200_4_frame_0000001845_1
- normals & rectification seem fishy

Questions:

- what is the plan for the meeting with professor Matas

- contribution:
    - synthesis
        - "impl tricks"?
    - math analysis? - parameters
    - contact Dr. Sattler - discuss impl details? (1st author - Toft )

- what is this?
    - https://github.com/ubc-vision/image-matching-benchmark/tree/master/utils

- matches = bf.knnMatch(descs1, descs2, k=2)
    # For cross-check
    matches2 = bf.match(descs2, descs1)
    good =[]
    # corner case
    if len(matches) < 10:
        return None, [], []
    for m,n in matches:
        if matches2[m.trainIdx].trainIdx != m.queryIdx:
            continue
        if m.distance < 0.85 *n.distance:
            good.append(m)
