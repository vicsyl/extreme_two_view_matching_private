AdaLAM integration:

a) basically run AdaLam with rectified descriptions and locations of the keypoints
    - imagine just corresponding planes
    - from local affine to global
    - number of seeds > 1
    - area_ratio down, search_expansion up

b) more selectively
    - if both corresponding seeds on a plane, restrict the other matches to the same plane tuples

c) depth + normal

- !!! Essential (5 points alg.) not affected by dominating plane
- limit to img-pairs where rect. is worse
- (sacraceur - non-orthogonal, reichcstag)



- how to measure the performance
 - AUC:?
 - how many matches compatible with ground truth
 - get the matches and run ransac from these
